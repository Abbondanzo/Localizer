# Localizer
Open-source project made to accelerate your web localization process. Simple tooling to help you get started.

## Installation
This project uses [Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/) and relies heavily on [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) for compiling. 
```bash
# Installs all dependencies
npm install
```

```bash
# Compiles source files into the public/ folder
npm run build
```

Project still in progress. Documentation will be updated to reflect changes.
